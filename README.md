# playlist-editor
Edits all file paths in a playlist. My first useful script, I used it to make my winamp playlist work after changing computers and operating systems. Written in 2016.

Being a very simple script, there is no real user input. You will have to configure the script yourself. The comments are very helpful but here are the directions.

Set the first argument of old_playlist to the name of the playlist you want to edit. Then set the first argument of new_playlist to the name of the playlist copy you want to create.

The script will replace all instances of the substring defined in old_path with the string defined in new_path. Adjust these strings, and remember to escape the backslashes!

Run the script and enjoy your new playlist copy.
